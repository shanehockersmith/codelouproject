# codelouproject
This webiste has been designed to meet the requirements for Code Louiville's final project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
This is a site for an imaginary band called "Giant Moose".
The site uses multiple CSS features to help with accessibility and design when scaling between screen sizes. The navigation bar grows and stretches when used on larger screens, and shrinks and goes vertical for smaller screens. 
Also, flexbox is used on the music page to lay the columns side-by-side on large screens and then vertically when on smaller screens, such as phones and tablets. 
:Nth of type is used on the tour page to alternate colors to better distinguish between dates. 
Lastly, JavaScript is used to validate Email on the contact page. If user enters an incorrect email address, they will be given a message to highlight the error. When a correct email is typed in, they'll receive a message letting them know they'll be contacted soon.
